++- [JR] Create a local nodejs server to avoid CORS (usage: 'nodejs site.js', then connect with 'http://localhost:3000/index.html')
+-- [JR] Use InputManager for game input instead of direct key access
+-- [JE/JR] Network lobbys
--- Parse received players from server, and setup a game with them
--- Extract room join/leave/management from multiplayer.js into game.js, and just multiplayer.js for the game itself
--- Better game sessions and query states (is game running, is game over, start new game with specified players), so from outside we can start/stop/run games
--- [JR] Add some physics to ball movement (accel/deceleration)
--- Graphics pass (background mostly)
--- Sound pass
--- Fancy UI pass
--- Add queue and spectator mode to network
